/*
ps:
we have to check if given number is power of two or not 



soln:
we know if we represent any number that is power of two
then its msb is set to 1 and rest to zero 
so if we take and with n -1 it should give zero 

for other number 
like 7 & 6 
lsb for 7 is 1  => msb is 1 
lsb for 6 is 0  => msb is 1 

so when we will do and 
msb will be 1 not 0 

what if: 

-2 
0
1
7
8
