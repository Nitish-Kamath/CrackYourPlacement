class Solution {
public:
    int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {

        priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>>minhp;

        for(auto x : nums)
        {

            minhp.push(x);
            if(minhp.size() > k)
            minhp.pop();
        }
        return minhp.top();
    }
};


/*
ps:
very easy 
we are given a nums array 
and we are given k value 
and we have to return element that is at kth position after sorting in descending order

note: elmenet may not be kth distince element 

solution:
what we can do we can make a minHeap 
and put element as it is 
and write condition if element exceeds than k then pop it 
and end element at top will be required answer 

what if : 
2 2 2 and k = 1 
2 2 2 and k = 2 
2 2 2 and k = 3


hack:
01.minHeap
