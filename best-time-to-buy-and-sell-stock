class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& nums) {

        int start = 0, end = 0, profit = 0,maxi = 0;
        while(end < nums.size())
        {
            if(nums[end] < nums[start])
            nums[start] = nums[end];

            profit = nums[end] - nums[start];
            maxi = max(maxi,profit);
            end++;


        }
        return maxi;
    }
};


/*
ps:
we are allowed for only one transaction 
so we have to find max profit 

soln:
here it could be solved using two pointer approach
whenever a smaller values comes we make them as start value 
and calculation profit for each instance 
and using maxi variable to get required result.
