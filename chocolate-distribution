class Solution{
    public:
    long long findMinDiff(vector<long long> a, long long n, long long m){

    sort(a.begin(),a.end());
    int mini = INT_MAX;

    }   
};


/*
ps:
Here we have to select m packet out of n packet 
such that diff is minm

soln:
it is preety easy sorting question 
here we have to sort and then take diff and use mini variable to get required result.
