class Solution {
public:
    int minMoves(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        int sum = 0;

        for(int i = 1;i < n;i++)
            sum += nums[i] - nums[0];
        return sum;
    }
};

/*
ps:
very simple, we have to make every element equal for nums of size n 
at each move we can only incrase n-1 element by 1 
soln:
if you do some maths then you reach at calculation that 
we have to take diff of each element with first element 
and sum of these diff value
at end return the sum value 

start:
sort -> reach to first element
